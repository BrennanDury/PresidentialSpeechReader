Cindy McCain: (00:00)
I want you to know how deeply honored I am to endorse you.

Joe Biden: (00:04)
You have no idea what it means to me.

Cindy McCain: (00:05)
To be a part of your campaign and be a part of doing what’s right for this country. I feel good about it. I’m not going to change my party, but I believe what I’m doing is the right thing. In this administration, there is no character, or integrity or values. That’s why you’re so important because you represent all of those things.

Joe Biden: (00:20)
Thank you.

Cindy McCain: (00:26)
And more so. Indeed, what this country needs right now, completely. Empathy and compassion, a lot of times that’s the only thing we really need on a day that’s really bad. Your empathy and compassion for those less fortunate have meant the world to me, and I know to many people.

Joe Biden: (00:43)
Well, that’s who John was. That’s who John was with me. I had just lost my family when John and I met.

Cindy McCain: (00:51)
Right.

Joe Biden: (00:52)
The way John embraced my boys, Hunter and Beau.

Cindy McCain: (00:56)
I loved to watch the two of you go at it on the floor, and they go arm in arm off the floor. You didn’t always agree, and you were so good at that. That bipartisanship and the common ground was really what made the two of you very special. [crosstalk 00:01:10].

Joe Biden: (01:10)
Cindy, thank you.

Cindy McCain: (01:12)
Thank you.

Joe Biden: (01:12)
Thank you so much. I love you.
